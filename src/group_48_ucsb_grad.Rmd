# Read in the data

Use the `read_csv()` fuction and the `here` package to read in ucsb_grad_data.csv

```{r}
#Read in data
ucsb_grad <- read_csv(here("data", "ucsb_grad_data.csv"))
```

# Clean Data

Create new columns named `year_full` that extracts the full year from `year` column. We will use this in the plot for later.

```{r}
#Extract full year in new column
#Substring first 4 characters from `year` column
ucsb_grad$year_full <- substr(ucsb_grad$year, 1, 4)
```


# Visualize Data

Create a column graph showing the change in domestic enrollment (y-axis: `domestic_enrollment`) by year from 2008 - 2019 (x-axis: `year_abbr`)

```{r}
#Column plot
ggplot(data = ucsb_grad,
       aes(x = year_full, y = domestic_enrollment)) +
  
  #Define column plot
  #Color by ethnicity
  #Convert column counts to proportions
  geom_col(aes(fill = ethnicity),
           position = "fill") + 
  
  #Change fill color
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3") +
  
  #Change x-axis and y-axis labels
  #Add title
  #Change legend title
  labs(x = "Year",  
       y = "Domestic Graduate Enrollment at UCSB (%)", 
       title = "Demographics of UCSB Domestic Graduate Student \nEnrollment from 2008 - 2019",
       fill = "Ethnicity") + 
  
  #Change theme
  theme_minimal() +
  
  #Center title
  #Change size of x-tick marks
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 9))
```
**Figure 1.** Demographics of UCSB Domestic Graduate Student Enrollment by Year. From 2008 to 2019, white students dominated the enrollment numbers with upwards of 50% enrolled each year. All other races and ethnicities listed make up a much smaller percentage of the total enrollment each year. Data source: UCSB, Campus Profiles (2008-2019).
